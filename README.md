# CityBikeDataFrontend
Frontend for viewing data about city bike stations and trips in Helsinki.

## How to run:

 - Either download the CityBikeDataFrontend.apk and run than on an Android device or
 - Clone this project to Android studio and build it.
 
## Functionality:

 - On first boot the app will ask for your backend url. Don't forget to start the url with the protocol and end it with the port (for example "http://192.168.8.110:8080").
 - Then the app will open to a simple selection screen from where you can go see stations or trips.
 - Nothing much more to it. Unfortunately.
